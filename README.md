# CashFlow Pro — Dashboard & Upload Flow

This project implements a **two-page flow** for client financial data management:

1. **Dashboard Page** — shows a welcome card and buttons to “Add Client Data” / “Upload Client Documents”.
2. **Upload Page** — document type selection, drag-and-drop file upload (PDF, CSV, Excel up to 10MB), file list with remove option, and an upload button.

## 🛠 Tech Stack Used
- **React** — frontend library
- **Vite** — fast development server & build tool
- **TypeScript** — for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — styling with utility classes
- **React Router** — navigation between Dashboard and Upload pages
